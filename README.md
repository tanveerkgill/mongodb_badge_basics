A. Relational databases, such as MySQL, and non-relational databases, such as MongoDB, differ significantly in how they store and organize data. Whereas MongoDB stores data as adaptable, JSON-like documents that can have different structures, MySQL employs tables with defined schemas. This makes it easier for MongoDB to manage unstructured or quickly changing data.

B. For managing patient health records from many sources, including wearables, test results, and telehealth notes, a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be perfect in the medical field. MongoDB's flexible schema allows for seamless integration and real-time updates without requiring frequent schema changes because each patient's data may have different properties.
